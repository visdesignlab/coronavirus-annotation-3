1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.940
Sars CoV II is the virus
that causes COVID-19.

2
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.940
The viral surface is studded with spike
proteins shown in teal membrane proteins

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.780
shown in yellow and envelope proteins
shown in red in crosssection.

4
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:19.260
The viral RNA genome in Orange is wrapped
around nucleicapsed protein shown in Gray.

5
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.140
An individual can be infected

6
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.220
with SARS CoV two after inhaling
airborne viral particles.

7
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.940
These viruses can then travel
into the Airways, where they may encounter

8
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.860
cells of the respiratory epithelium
in the trachea and lungs.

9
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.780
The spike protein on SARSCoV two
recognizes a specific protein called ace

10
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.740
two, which is shown here
in purple on the cell surface.

11
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.660
The spike protein, which is normally very
dynamic and able to undergo opening,

12
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.180
closing, and bending movements,
is locked into an open position.

13
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.860
After binding to ace two, another protein.

14
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.620
On the cell surface called Temporis two.

15
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.060
And shown in Orange, can then cut
the spike protein in a specific location.

16
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.100
These segments of the spike protein fall

17
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.300
away, exposing a portion of the spike
protein, which was previously hidden.

18
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.600
The spike protein is then able to undergo

19
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.570
a series of dramatic
conformational changes.

20
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.700
During the first stage,

21
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.260
the spike protein inserts itself
into the membrane of the cell.

22
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.100
In the second stage, segments of the spike
protein zipper back on itself,

23
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.700
forcing the membrane of the cell
and the viral membrane to fuse.

24
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.140
After fusion, the viral RNA is deposited

25
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.700
into the host cell, where it will direct
the cell to produce more variants.

26
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.820
Once the nucleic capsid is inside
the cell, ribosomes start translating

27
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.760
the polyprotein precursor
of the nonstructural viral proteins.

28
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.420
It is hypothesized that the progression
of the ribosomes along the viral RNA

29
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.290
results in the disassembly
of the Nproteins.

30
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.880
The precise timing of polyprotein
processing, however, is unclear.

31
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.140
Soon after NSP Three S protease domain is

32
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.140
translated, it is thought to start
cleaving NSPS One, two, and three.

33
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.940
Msps.

34
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.220
Three, four,
and six are inserted into the er membrane

35
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.680
through an unknown mechanism
and NSP five processes.

36
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.560
The remaining portion of the elongating
polyprotein

37
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.020
ribosomal frameshifting is a key
event during early translation.

38
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.660
It occurs at a slippery sequence located

39
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.700
in the context of a pseudonot structure
just upstream of the first stop codon.

40
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.340
If a ribosome melts the pseudonut quickly,
it progresses without frameshifting

41
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.240
and then disassembles
at the first stop codon.

42
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.180
Nsp Five then Cleaves the polyprotein

43
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.160
precursor

44
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.800
the pseudonotholds,

45
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.060
before it is encountered
by a closely trailing ribosome.

46
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.060
This time, the pause induced
from the pseudonaut results in a minus one

47
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.680
frame shift, allowing the ribosome
to progress beyond the stop codon.

48
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.860
In this case, NSP's twelve to 16 can be

49
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.360
translated, and the polyprotein
is processed by NSP Five.

50
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.460
In parallel, the er undergoes a striking
but poorly understood remodeling event.

51
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.540
Nsps three and four interact
to induce membrane pairing.

52
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.040
This promotes membrane curvature.

53
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.500
Msps and the genomic RNA are trapped

54
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:24.200
into double membrane vesicles, or DMVs,
that form through unclear mechanisms.

55
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.220
To propagate itself,
the virus must replicate its genome

56
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.300
and generate a large number
of subgenomic RNAs in the DMVs.

57
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.740
The viral genome is about 30 kilobases

58
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.340
long, and its three primen consists
of genes encoding structural proteins.

59
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.900
These genes are transcribed
into a nested set of subgenomic RNAs.

60
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.220
The first set of subgenomic
RNAs are negative sense RNAs.

61
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.980
These are later copied into positive sense
RNAs that serve as messenger RNA templates

62
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.780
for the translation
of structural proteins.

63
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.620
An interesting feature of the subgenomic
RNAs is that they all share a copy

64
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.260
of the leader sequence that is present
at the five prime end of the genomic RNA.

65
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.660
So how does this leader or L sequence
get added to all the subgenomic RNAs?

66
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.380
This process involves a series

67
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.020
of sequences called transcription
regulatory sequences, or TRSs.

68
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.820
The TRS are present at the junctions
between each open reading frame of genes

69
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.360
encoding structural and accessory
proteins, as well as in the leader

70
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.540
sequence at the five prime
end of the genomic RNA.

71
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.640
The core sequence of these TRS is highly
conserved, and the leader TRS is thought

72
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:42.100
to remain in close proximity to a body TRS
for base pairing during transcription.

73
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.620
When the RTC reaches a body TRS and copies
its core sequence, it can either continue

74
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.900
or switch to the five prime end
of the genomic RNA where the copied TRS

75
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.380
matches with the leader TRS,
leading to continuous transcription.

76
00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.980
In this way, all the subgenomic RNAs

77
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.220
obtain the leader sequence
at their three prime end.

78
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.820
The RTC is a replication transcription
complex made up of NSPS.

79
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.660
However, its specific function
is not yet well understood.

80
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:11.780
In the next segment,

81
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:18.700
we will show two Hypotheses that are
currently being tested in DMVs.

82
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.940
Replication and transcription are carried

83
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.580
out by the replication
transcription complex.

84
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.540
The core structure of the RTC consists
of NSPS, seven, eight, and twelve.

85
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.180
They assemble at the three prime end
of a template genomic RNA and initiate

86
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:38.220
transcription with the help
of NSPS 1013, 14, and 16.

87
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:43.020
It is hypothesized that transcription
pauses when the RTC reaches transcription

88
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.900
regulating sequences, or TRS,
shown here in yellow.

89
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.580
Its helicase domain can then act
on the doublestranded RNA,

90
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.180
causing RTC backtracking and unwinding
of the doublestranded RNA.

91
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.460
The core sequence of the TRS
is highly conserved.

92
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.040
Therefore, when the copied TRS
at the three prime end of a newly

93
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.540
synthesized RNA matches with the TRS
in the leader sequence at the five prime

94
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:11.140
end of a template genomic RNA,
transcription elongation continues.

95
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.340
In this way, all the newly synthesized

96
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.920
RNAs can obtain the leader
sequence at their three prime end.

97
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.680
In DMVs, replication and transcription are

98
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.620
carried out by a replication
transcription complex.

99
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:29.500
The core structure of RTC consists
of NSPS, seven, eight, and twelve.

100
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.020
It is hypothesized that the genomic RNA

101
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.860
first needs to be
replicated in full length.

102
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:38.220
Nsp 13 binds to the positive RNA strand

103
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:44.020
in transcription regulatory sequences,
or TRSs, in order to keep an open bubble.

104
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:49.100
Meanwhile, the RTC assembles at the three
prime end of the positive genomic RNA

105
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:54.220
and initiates transcription
with the help of NSPS 1014 and 16.

106
00:07:54.250 --> 00:08:00.260
When the RTC reaches a TRS, it pauses
and disassociates from the template RNA.

107
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.840
Then, the RTC is recruited by the leader

108
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.700
TRS at the five prime end
of the positive genomic RNA.

109
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:10.140
The core sequence of the TRS
is highly conserved.

110
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:13.780
Therefore, when the copied TRS
at the three prime end of a newly

111
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:19.260
synthesized RNA matches with the leader
TRS, transcription elongation continues.

112
00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.380
In this way, all the newly synthesized

113
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:26.120
RNAs can obtain the leader
sequence at their three prime end.

114
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.300
Over the course of hours, the cell.

115
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:34.580
Has transformed into a viral factory and
will soon release newly formed viruses.

116
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.300
At the DMVs, numerous copies of viral.

117
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.100
RNAs have been produced.

118
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.660
Rnas are thought to be released

119
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.340
into the cytosol through
pores in the DMV membrane.

120
00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.700
The viral genomic RNA interacts

121
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:51.380
with Nucleocapsid or Nprotein,
which acts to compact the RNA.

122
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.700
Meanwhile, structural viral proteins

123
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:58.300
including matrix envelope and spike
proteins have been translated by ribosomes

124
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:04.140
at the Er and transported to the Er Golgi
intermediate compartment or Ergic.

125
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.820
At the Ergic membrane,

126
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:11.940
the RNA and Nproteins bud inwards
with the help of matrix proteins.

127
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.820
New viruses are then thought to be.

128
00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.580
Transported between different membrane

129
00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:20.500
compartments including Lysosomes
and the multiversecular body or MVB.

130
00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:22.580
Fusion of the MVB with the plasma.

131
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.020
Membrane releases the newly formed viruses

132
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:29.880
to the extracellular space where they are
able to attach to and infect new cells.
