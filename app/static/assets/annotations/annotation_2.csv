3,00:00-00:16,spike protein,FALSE,structure,Full-length glycosylated S protein model was downloaded from CHARMM-GUI. This model was modified from PDB 6VSB. The animation shows a 'breathing' motion where different subunits are in the 'up' state at different times. The relative length of time that the subunits should spend in the up state was uncertain.,,http://www.charmm-gui.org/?doc=archive&lib=covid19,

Significant uncertainty about the structure of RNP; not clear how flexible RNP should be, whether it should be branched, etc.","Chun-Yuan Chen, Chung-ke Chang, Yi-Wei Chang, Shih-Che Sue, Hsin-I Bai, Lilianty Riang, Chwan-Deng Hsiao, and Tai-huang Huang.
